I'm an instructor for the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia and a data science consultant. I've had a wonderfully diverse career to date in research, teaching, and engineering and data science consulting. While I presently teach and practice data science, my background is in the Earth sciences and civil engineering, and I remain fascinated with the natural and engineered world, and how data science can be used to solve real-world problems.
