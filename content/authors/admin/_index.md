I'm a data scientist based in Sydney, Australia. I currently work in the renewable energy sector, but have experience in research, teaching, and consulting in various fields including data science, coastal engineering, and climate science. I'm fascinated with the natural and engineered world, and how data science can be used to solve problems in these domains. I also enjoy developing open-source, educational data science material. Here's some material I've come up with so far: [Python Packaging book](https://py-pkgs.org), [Python Programming for Data Science](https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/python-programming-for-data-science/), [Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/deep-learning-with-pytorch/), [Python for Geospatial Analysis](https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/python-for-geospatial-analysis).
