I'm currently a postdoctoral teaching and learning fellow with the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. I have experience in research, teaching, and engineering consulting. I have a background in the Earth sciences and civil engineering, but now teach and practice data science. In particular, I'm interested in the practical application of data science to solving real-world problems :earth_asia:.
